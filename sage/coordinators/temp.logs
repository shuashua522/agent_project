You are an agent who controls smart homes. You always try to perform actions on their smart devices in response to user input.

Instructions:
- Try to personalize your actions when necessary.
- Plan several steps ahead in your thoughts
- The user's commands are not always clear, sometimes you will need to apply critical thinking
- Tools work best when you give them as much information as possible
- Only provide the channel number when manipulating the TV.
- Only perform the task requested by the user, don't schedule additional tasks
- You cannot interact with the user and ask questions.
- You can assume that all the devices are smart.

You have access to the following tools:


smartthings_tool:
Use this to interact with homeassitant. Accepts natural language commands. Do not omit any details from the original command. Use this tool to determine which device can accomplish the query.


Use the following format:

Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [smartthings_tool]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I now know the final answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question


You must always output a thought, action, and action input.

Question: 将整个房子变暗
Thought:

> Finished chain.
The user wants to dim the lights in the entire house. I will use the smart home assistant to dim all the lights.

You are an agent that assists with queries against some API.

Instructions:
- Include a description of what you've done in the final answer, include device IDs
- If you encounter an error, try to think what is the best action to solve the error instead of trial and error.

Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests:
api_usage_planner: Used to generate a plan of api calls to make to execute a command. The input to this tool is the user command in natural language. Always share the original user command to this tool to provide the overall context.
get_all_entity_id: Returns an array of state objects.
    Each state has the following attributes: entity_id, state, last_changed and attributes.
get_services_by_domain: return all services included in the domain.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
domain (str)
get_states_by_entity_id: Returns a state object for specified entity_id.
    Returns 404 if not found.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
    entity_id (str)
execute_domain_service_by_entity_id:
    Calls a service within a specific domain. Will return when the service has been executed.

    Returns a list of states that have changed while the service was being executed, and optionally response data, if supported by the service.
    Input to the tool should be a json string with 3 keys:
    domain (str)
    service (str)
    body (str)

    Additional notes on the body: The value of 'Content-Type' must be 'application/json'. The body must contain at least the 'entity_id' (and there must be exactly one 'entity_id' in the body). If the service requires additional parameters, please provide them accordingly.

You are a planner that helps users interact with their smart devices.
You are given a list of high level summaries of device capabilities ("all capabilities:").
You are also given a list of available devices ("devices you can use") which will tell you the name and device ID of the device, as well as listing which capabilities the device has.
Your job is to figure out the sequence of which devices and capabilities to use in order to execute the user's command.

Follow these instructions:
- Include device IDs (guid strings), capability ids, and explanations of what needs to be done in your plan.
- It is often unclear exactly which device / devices the user is referring to. If you don't know exactly which device to use, list all of the device IDs. Try to come-up with a disambiguation strategy, otherwise explain that further disambiguation is required.
- The capability information you receive is not detailed. Often there will be multiple capabilities that sound like they might work. You should list all of the ones that might work to be safe.
- Don't always assume the devices are already on.
- Some devices can have more than one components. If using one results in a failure, try another one.

   - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 for 灯泡
2. Use the brightness down button capability (button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1) for 米家智能台灯Lite to dim the light.
3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

I have successfully dimmed all the lights in the house. The "米家智能台灯Lite" was dimmed using its specific brightness down button (entity ID: button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1), and the "灯泡" light was dimmed by adjusting its brightness to 50 using general light control (entity ID: light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2). Both lights are now set to a dimmer setting as requested. <FINISHED>

You are an agent that assists with queries against some API.

Instructions:
- Include a description of what you've done in the final answer, include device IDs
- If you encounter an error, try to think what is the best action to solve the error instead of trial and error.

Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests:
api_usage_planner: Used to generate a plan of api calls to make to execute a command. The input to this tool is the user command in natural language. Always share the original user command to this tool to provide the overall context.
get_all_entity_id: Returns an array of state objects.
    Each state has the following attributes: entity_id, state, last_changed and attributes.
get_services_by_domain: return all services included in the domain.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
domain (str)
get_states_by_entity_id: Returns a state object for specified entity_id.
    Returns 404 if not found.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
    entity_id (str)
execute_domain_service_by_entity_id:
    Calls a service within a specific domain. Will return when the service has been executed.

    Returns a list of states that have changed while the service was being executed, and optionally response data, if supported by the service.
    Input to the tool should be a json string with 3 keys:
    domain (str)
    service (str)
    body (str)

    Additional notes on the body: The value of 'Content-Type' must be 'application/json'. The body must contain at least the 'entity_id' (and there must be exactly one 'entity_id' in the body). If the service requires additional parameters, please provide them accordingly.


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [api_usage_planner, get_all_entity_id, get_services_by_domain, get_states_by_entity_id, execute_domain_service_by_entity_id]

Human:
User query: Dim all the lights in the house.
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query.
Action: api_usage_planner
Action Input: Dim all the lights in the house.
Observation: Device Ids:
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Capabilities:
- button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1 (米家智能台灯Lite * 个性化功能 亮度-)
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Plan:
1. Ensure all lights are powered on. If not, turn them on using the respective light control capabilities:
   - light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 for 米家智能台灯Lite
   - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 for 灯泡
2. Use the brightness down button capability (button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1) for 米家智能台灯Lite to dim the light.
3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

Explanation:
- The 米家智能台灯Lite has a specific button for dimming the brightness, which can be used directly.
- For the 灯泡, the capability to dim might not be explicitly listed, so general light control might be used to adjust brightness. Further disambiguation or additional device capabilities might be required to confirm the exact method of dimming for this device.

User query: Dim all the lights in the house.
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query.
Action: api_usage_planner
Action Input: Dim all the lights in the house.
Observation: Device Ids:
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Capabilities:
- button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1 (米家智能台灯Lite * 个性化功能 亮度-)
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Plan:
1. Ensure all lights are powered on. If not, turn them on using the respective light control capabilities:
   - light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 for 米家智能台灯Lite
   - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 for 灯泡
2. Use the brightness down button capability (button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1) for 米家智能台灯Lite to dim the light.
3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

Explanation:
- The 米家智能台灯Lite has a specific button for dimming the brightness, which can be used directly.
- For the 灯泡, the capability to dim might not be explicitly listed, so general light control might be used to adjust brightness. Further disambiguation or additional device capabilities might be required to confirm the exact method of dimming for this device.

You are an agent that assists with queries against some API.

Instructions:
- Include a description of what you've done in the final answer, include device IDs
- If you encounter an error, try to think what is the best action to solve the error instead of trial and error.

Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests:
api_usage_planner: Used to generate a plan of api calls to make to execute a command. The input to this tool is the user command in natural language. Always share the original user command to this tool to provide the overall context.
get_all_entity_id: Returns an array of state objects.
    Each state has the following attributes: entity_id, state, last_changed and attributes.
get_services_by_domain: return all services included in the domain.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
domain (str)
get_states_by_entity_id: Returns a state object for specified entity_id.
    Returns 404 if not found.Input to the tool should be a json string with 1 keys:
    entity_id (str)
execute_domain_service_by_entity_id:
    Calls a service within a specific domain. Will return when the service has been executed.

    Returns a list of states that have changed while the service was being executed, and optionally response data, if supported by the service.
    Input to the tool should be a json string with 3 keys:
    domain (str)
    service (str)
    body (str)

    Additional notes on the body: The value of 'Content-Type' must be 'application/json'. The body must contain at least the 'entity_id' (and there must be exactly one 'entity_id' in the body). If the service requires additional parameters, please provide them accordingly.

3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

Explanation:
- The 米家智能台灯Lite has a specific button for dimming the brightness, which can be used directly.
- For the 灯泡, the capability to dim might not be explicitly listed, so general light control might be used to adjust brightness. Further disambiguation or additional device capabilities might be required to confirm the exact method of dimming for this device.

   - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 for 灯泡
2. Use the brightness down button capability (button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1) for 米家智能台灯Lite to dim the light.
3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

Explanation:
- The 米家智能台灯Lite has a specific button for dimming the brightness, which can be used directly.
- For the 灯泡, the capability to dim might not be explicitly listed, so general light control might be used to adjust brightness. Further disambiguation or additional device capabilities might be required to confirm the exact method of dimming for this device.

    Calls a service within a specific domain. Will return when the service has been executed.

    Returns a list of states that have changed while the service was being executed, and optionally response data, if supported by the service.
    Input to the tool should be a json string with 3 keys:
    domain (str)
    service (str)
    body (str)

    Additional notes on the body: The value of 'Content-Type' must be 'application/json'. The body must contain at least the 'entity_id' (and there must be exactly one 'entity_id' in the body). If the service requires additional parameters, please provide them accordingly.

User query: Dim all the lights in the house.
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query.
Action: api_usage_planner
Action Input: Dim all the lights in the house.
Observation: Device Ids:
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Capabilities:
- button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1 (米家智能台灯Lite * 个性化功能 亮度-)
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)

Plan:
1. Ensure all lights are powered on. If not, turn them on using the respective light control capabilities:
   - light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 for 米家智能台灯Lite
   - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 for 灯泡
2. Use the brightness down button capability (button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1) for 米家智能台灯Lite to dim the light.
3. For the 灯泡 (light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2), if it supports dimming through a similar method, adjust the brightness accordingly. If no specific dimming capability is listed, attempt to adjust through general light control.

Explanation:
- The 米家智能台灯Lite has a specific button for dimming the brightness, which can be used directly.
- For the 灯泡, the capability to dim might not be explicitly listed, so general light control might be used to adjust brightness. Further disambiguation or additional device capabilities might be required to confirm the exact method of dimming for this device.
<FINISHED>
Thought:I need to check the state of each light to ensure they are powered on before attempting to dim them.

You are an agent that assists with queries against some API.

Instructions:
- Include a description of what you've done in the final answer, include device IDs
- If you encounter an error, try to think what is the best action to solve the error instead of trial and error.

Here are the tools to plan and execute API requests:

You are a planner that helps users interact with their smart devices.
You are given a list of high level summaries of device capabilities ("all capabilities:").
You are also given a list of available devices ("devices you can use") which will tell you the name and device ID of the device, as well as listing which capabilities the device has.
Your job is to figure out the sequence of which devices and capabilities to use in order to execute the user's command.

Follow these instructions:
- Include device IDs (guid strings), capability ids, and explanations of what needs to be done in your plan.
- It is often unclear exactly which device / devices the user is referring to. If you don't know exactly which device to use, list all of the device IDs. Try to come-up with a disambiguation strategy, otherwise explain that further disambiguation is required.
- The capability information you receive is not detailed. Often there will be multiple capabilities that sound like they might work. You should list all of the ones that might work to be safe.
- Don't always assume the devices are already on.
- Some devices can have more than one components. If using one results in a failure, try another one.

You are a planner that helps users interact with their smart devices.
You are given a list of high level summaries of device capabilities ("all capabilities:").
You are also given a list of available devices ("devices you can use") which will tell you the name and device ID of the device, as well as listing which capabilities the device has.
Your job is to figure out the sequence of which devices and capabilities to use in order to execute the user's command.

Follow these instructions:
- Include device IDs (guid strings), capability ids, and explanations of what needs to be done in your plan.
- It is often unclear exactly which device / devices the user is referring to. If you don't know exactly which device to use, list all of the device IDs. Try to come-up with a disambiguation strategy, otherwise explain that further disambiguation is required.
- The capability information you receive is not detailed. Often there will be multiple capabilities that sound like they might work. You should list all of the ones that might work to be safe.
- Don't always assume the devices are already on.
- Some devices can have more than one components. If using one results in a failure, try another one.

    entity_id (str)
execute_domain_service_by_entity_id:
    Calls a service within a specific domain. Will return when the service has been executed.

    Returns a list of states that have changed while the service was being executed, and optionally response data, if supported by the service.
    Input to the tool should be a json string with 3 keys:
    domain (str)
    service (str)
    body (str)

    Additional notes on the body: The value of 'Content-Type' must be 'application/json'. The body must contain at least the 'entity_id' (and there must be exactly one 'entity_id' in the body). If the service requires additional parameters, please provide them accordingly.


Starting below, you should follow this format:

User query: the query a User wants help with related to the API
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of the tools [api_usage_planner, get_all_entity_id, get_services_by_domain, get_states_by_entity_id, execute_domain_service_by_entity_id]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the information the user asked for or the data the user asked to create
Final Answer: the final output from executing the plan. Add <FINISHED> after your final answer.

Your must always output a thought, action, and action input.
Do not forget to say I'm finished when the user's command is executed.
Begin!

Human:
User query: Dim the desk lamp.
Thought: I should generate a plan to help with this query.
Action: api_usage_planner
Action Input: Dim the desk lamp.
Observation: Device Ids: philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1 (米家智能台灯Lite - Desk Lamp)
Capabilities: button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1 (Brightness Down)
Plan:
1. Ensure the desk lamp (米家智能台灯Lite) is powered on. If unsure, toggle the power using the capability button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1.
2. Use the capability button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_brightness_down_a_3_1 to dim the brightness of the desk lamp.

Explanation:
- The device ID and capability ID are specific to the 米家智能台灯Lite, which is identified as a desk lamp.
- The capability to dim the lamp is directly related to the "Brightness Down" button capability.
- If the lamp is not already on, the toggle capability can be used to ensure it is powered before attempting to dim it.
<FINISHED>
Thought:


> Finished chain.
I need to check the current state of the desk lamp to determine if it is on or off before proceeding with the dimming action.
