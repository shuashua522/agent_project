Preferences are: Group the light bulbs and speakers into the 'Atmosphere' group; Remember that I prefer the living room light to be at 30% brightness; The desk lamp is too bright—adjusting its brightness to 20% is sufficient; Oh, when sleeping, I don't like a dark environment as it scares me; Let's play Jay Chou's songs instead—they are my favorite; When I'm on a call, don't let the devices make noise; Oh, there is a bathroom in my room; When reading, I like to sit on the living room sofa because when I'm tired, looking at the living room plants helps me relax; Do not turn off the home sockets without my explicit instruction—they are connected to my server; The living room light at 3000K makes me feel the most comfortable; I like warm and healing stories about animals and children; The gateway's WiFi is currently connected to my hotspot (dddiu); Do you know what the scariest scenario is? Lights flickering with scary background music; Before going to bed, I will play with my phone for a while—set the lights to fade out and turn off after 30 minutes; On Sundays, I usually get up at dawn; During summer vacation, I sleep on the living room sofa every night and keep the windows open, which makes me sleep soundly; I usually go to bed at 11 PM and get up around 7 AM; When the weather is nice, open the windows for ventilation

Yes — I found one story preference in memory:

- Prefers warm, healing stories about animals and children.

There is no stored preference about story length, specific characters or POV, nor any previously saved favorite stories. Would you like me to save additional details (preferred length, narration style, specific character types, or any favorites) so I can use them next time?

Mina moved into the small house at the end of the lane in early spring, when the maple trees were still promising leaves. The rooms smelled faintly of lemon cleaner and the sunlight made soft shapes on the wooden floor. Mina was seven and carried a little suitcase of mismatched socks and a pocket notebook full of pressed clover. She liked the hush of new places, but this hush sometimes felt like being the last echo in a very large room.

On her first morning, she found a robin beneath the window box. It was small and ruffled, one wing tucked awkwardly. Its chest heaved with shallow, frightened breaths. Mina knelt in the grass and remembered how her grandmother used to hum while darning socks—how the hum seemed to stitch quiet back into the house. She hummed then, a slow, steady sound, and the robin blinked. Hearing that low, human rhythm, it lowered its head as if listening to a kind word.

Mina made a soft bed from an old towel and carried the robin inside on cupped hands. She gave it a shallow saucer of water and a few crumbs of toast, but mostly she sat beside it and hummed. The days folded into one another like petals. She read aloud from picture books, telling the bird about boats and winter gardens. Her humming and stories warmed the little room more surely than any lamp.

Neighbors noticed. Mrs. Alvarez from next door brought a tiny box of seeds and a knot of yarn for nests. Mr. Chen, who kept a jar of honey for anyone with a cough, offered gentle advice about warmth. The local vet came by one afternoon, smiling the way people do when they see children doing something brave and kind. The vet wrapped the bird’s wing and said, quietly, “Nature has a soft way of asking for help sometimes.”

As the robin grew stronger, Mina watched it hop along the windowsill, practice fluttering, and catch sunbeams. Slowly, her own spaces filled with small, hopeful sounds: the robin’s tentative chirp, the clap of school friends’ shoes on the porch, the neighbor’s kettle singing at dusk. Mina learned how to braid grass for the robin’s future nests; the robin learned how to perch on her finger and wait without fear.

One luminous morning, the robin launched itself into the sky, a bright, sudden arrow against the blue. It circled once, then twice, and for a moment Mina thought it was saying thanks with its wings. It did not fly away forever. On many quiet afternoons after that, the robin returned, a soft, red-breasted visitor who would sit on the sill and listen to Mina hum about boats and gardens and new neighborhoods.

The house at the end of the lane stopped feeling like an echo and became a place that filled with small, certain sounds—doors that opened, laughter, the gentle rustle of feathers. Mina learned that care is a kind of homebuilding, and that healing, like humming, is patient and sweet.
