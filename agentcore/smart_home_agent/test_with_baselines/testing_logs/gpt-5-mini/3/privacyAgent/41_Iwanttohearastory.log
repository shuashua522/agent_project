Preferences are: Group the light bulbs and speakers into the 'Atmosphere' group; Remember that I prefer the living room light to be at 30% brightness; The desk lamp is too bright—adjusting its brightness to 20% is sufficient; Oh, when sleeping, I don't like a dark environment as it scares me; Let's play Jay Chou's songs instead—they are my favorite; When I'm on a call, don't let the devices make noise; Oh, there is a bathroom in my room; When reading, I like to sit on the living room sofa because when I'm tired, looking at the living room plants helps me relax; Do not turn off the home sockets without my explicit instruction—they are connected to my server; The living room light at 3000K makes me feel the most comfortable; I like warm and healing stories about animals and children; The gateway's WiFi is currently connected to my hotspot (dddiu); Do you know what the scariest scenario is? Lights flickering with scary background music; Before going to bed, I will play with my phone for a while—set the lights to fade out and turn off after 30 minutes; On Sundays, I usually get up at dawn; During summer vacation, I sleep on the living room sofa every night and keep the windows open, which makes me sleep soundly; I usually go to bed at 11 PM and get up around 7 AM; When the weather is nice, open the windows for ventilation

When the family moved to the little house by the river, Lina felt all the familiar things slip away: the playground she'd circled every day, the bakery that always gave her crumbs of warm bread, the faces that knew how she liked her hair braided. The new town smelled of wet earth and pine, and the rooms in the house sounded a little too big.

One rainy afternoon, Lina found something small and trembling under the porch steps: a puppy no bigger than her backpack, soaked and shivering, with one paw tucked under as if it hurt. Its fur was the color of autumn leaves, and when it looked at Lina, its eyes were round and honest and terribly brave for being so scared.

Lina wrapped the puppy in her scarf and carried it inside like a secret treasure. She made a nest of towels beside the radiator, fed it bits of toast, and whispered stories she had learned at her old school—about brave mice, clever birds, and children who found magic in ordinary places. The puppy listened as if he understood every word. Lina named him Pip, because his tiny whines sounded like tiny beeps.

At first, Pip flinched at footsteps and thunder and the rustle of leaves. He slept with one ear on guard and one eye open. Lina sat on the floor and read to him, her chin on her knees, until he drifted into sleep. She learned to move slowly, to offer a palm instead of a hug, to wait for him to choose trust. In return, Pip taught her how to pay attention to small things: the exact tilt of sunlight through the curtains, the soft way rain tapped the window, the way bread crumbs could make a grumpy neighbor smile.

Neighbors began to notice the two of them—Lina, with mud on her knees, and Pip, with a shaky tail that grew steadier every day. The woman who ran the corner shop mended Pip’s paw with gentle hands. The old man who fed pigeons brought extra seeds, and a boy from down the lane showed Lina how to make a tiny raft for fallen leaves so they could watch them sail on the slow river.

Seasons shifted. Pip’s limp faded, and his games grew bolder. Lina’s laughter started to linger in the rooms that had echoed with silence. Friends came visiting, and soon the porch was full of small voices and paw prints. The house that had felt too big became exactly right—full of story nights, muddy boots, wet towels drying on the line, and a dog who slept with his head on Lina’s feet.

One evening, as fireflies drifted across the garden, Lina pressed her forehead against Pip’s soft side and felt something gentle and steady settle inside her. She had found a new kind of belonging—not because everything was the same as before, but because she had carried kindness into a place where it could grow. Pip snuffled once, as if to say goodnight, and they both drifted to sleep under a sky that seemed to promise more small, brave mornings to come.
