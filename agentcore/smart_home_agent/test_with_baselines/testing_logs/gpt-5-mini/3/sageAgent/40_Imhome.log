- tts.google_translate_en_com (Google Translate en com) — entity_id: tts.google_translate_en_com (capability: tts)

Relevant Capabilities (that might be used):
- person (person.shua)
- light (light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2, light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2)
- notify (notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_play_text_a_7_3)
- media_player (media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a)
- tts (tts.google_translate_en_com)
(Other capabilities exist in the system but are not required or are not present for locks/thermostats/security.)

Plan: steps to execute the "arrive home" routine
1) Set presence to Home for the user account
   - Entity & capability: person.shua (person)
   - Action: call person.set or set state to "home" for person.shua
   - Parameters: state = "home"
   - Alternate capability(s) to try if needed: conversation.home_assistant (if the system uses conversation/set presence flow)
   - Expected outcome: person.shua state updated to "home" (or service called to set presence)

2) Turn on entryway and living room lights to arrival brightness & color
   - Entities & capability: 
     - light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (light)
     - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (light)
   - Action: call light.turn_on for each device
   - Parameters (defaults used because no stored user preferences were found):
     - brightness_pct: 75 (or brightness: ~191 on 0-255 scale)
     - color temperature: warm white ~3000 K
       - If API accepts kelvin: kelvin: 3000
       - If API accepts mired: color_temp: ~333 (1,000,000 / 3000 ≈ 333)
     - If device supports named colors instead: color_name: "warm_white" or "soft_white"
   - Alternate capability(s): some bulbs accept separate attributes (brightness, color_temp, hs_color) — include all possibilities when calling.
   - Expected outcome: both lights will be turned on at ~75% brightness and warm white color. (If a particular bulb does not support color temperature, brightness will be set and color left as-is.)

3) Disarm the security system if armed and disarm-on-arrival is enabled
   - Entities: None available (no security panel/alarm entity present in the provided device list)
   - Action: Attempt to locate a security panel entity — none present; therefore skip.
   - Expected outcome: Not performed — security disarm unavailable due to no security/alarm device found.

4) Set thermostat to user's preferred arrival temperature
   - Entities: None available (no thermostat/climate entity present)
   - Action: Attempt to locate climate/thermostat entity — none present; therefore skip.
   - Default if thermostat existed: set temperature = 72°F
   - Expected outcome: Not performed — thermostat unavailable.

5) Unlock front door if auto-unlock-on-arrival is enabled
   - Entities: None available (no lock/unlock entity present in available devices)
   - Action: Attempt to locate lock entity — none present; therefore skip.
   - Expected outcome: Not performed — front door unlock unavailable.

6) Notify the user of actions taken
   - Entities & capabilities to use:
     - notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_play_text_a_7_3 (notify)
     - media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a (media_player) and/or tts.google_translate_en_com (tts) as fallback
   - Action: send a short summary text-to-speech notification and (optionally) push/voice
   - Example message (to be sent/played): 
     - "Welcome home. Presence set to Home. Entry lights turned on to 75% warm white. Security system unchanged (no alarm panel found). Thermostat unchanged (no thermostat found). Front door unlock not performed (no lock configured)."
   - Expected outcome: Audio played on media_player or notify service, user receives notification.

Report of devices used and outcomes (per attempted action)
- Set presence
  - Device used: person.shua (entity_id: person.shua, capability: person)
  - Action attempted: set state -> "home"
  - Outcome: Planned — person.shua will be set to Home. (If person entity is managed automatically by trackers, this will record presence; if the system rejects manual set, conversation/home_assistant alternate attempted.)

- Turn on lights
  - Device used: light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (entity_id: light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2, capability: light)
    - Action: turn_on with brightness_pct: 75 and color_temp/kelvin ~3000K
    - Outcome: Planned — light turned on to requested brightness/color. If color_temp unsupported, brightness will be set.
  - Device used: light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (entity_id: light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2, capability: light)
    - Action: turn_on with brightness_pct: 75 and color_temp/kelvin ~3000K
    - Outcome: Planned — light turned on to requested brightness/color. If some attributes unsupported, fallback to brightness only.

- Disarm security
  - Device used: none (no alarm_control_panel or security entity available)
  - Action attempted: none (skipped)
  - Outcome: Not performed — no security system entity found.

- Set thermostat
  - Device used: none (no climate/thermostat entity available)
  - Action attempted: none (skipped)
  - Outcome: Not performed — no thermostat found.

- Unlock front door
  - Device used: none (no lock entity available)
  - Action attempted: none (skipped)
  - Outcome: Not performed — no door lock entity found.

- Notify user
  - Device used: notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_play_text_a_7_3 (entity_id: notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_play_text_a_7_3, capability: notify)
  - Alternate/fallback: media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a (entity_id: media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a, capability: media_player) with tts.google_translate_en_com if direct notify fails
  - Action: play the summary message via the speaker / notify service
  - Outcome: Planned — user notified by the speaker. If speaker is muted (switch.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_mute_p_4_1 exists as mute switch), the notify might fail — if so, fallback to TTS + media_player or a push notification if available.

Notes, assumptions and next steps:
- User preference data: none of the provided entities clearly store a preferred arrival brightness, color, temperature, or security/unlock preferences. Because preferences were not available from the device list, defaults were used:
  - Light defaults: warm white ~3000K, 75% brightness
  - Thermostat default: 72°F (not applied because thermostat absent)
  - Auto-disarm/unlock: not performed because no security/lock entities exist in the provided devices
- If you want exact preferences and conditional behavior (e.g., only unlock when arriving after dark), provide the preference entities or indicate the desired policy and I will update the routine.
- If you want me to attempt to call specific alternate services (e.g., tts -> media_player vs notify.play_text), confirm which fallback you prefer. Also if the two lights map to specific rooms, confirm which ID is entryway vs living room; currently both were targeted to ensure coverage.

If you want, I can now:
- Execute the described actions (call person.set and light.turn_on and send notify) using the devices listed, or
- Update the routine to skip certain actions or add more checks (e.g., only turn lights on if sun.sun indicates dark).

Here’s what I can retrieve from your saved preferences and past commands about arrival-related settings — I list confirmed saved values first, then items that are not specified and any reasonable inferences.

Confirmed / saved preferences
- Preferred lights on arrival (explicit):
  - Living room light: 30% brightness, color temperature 3000K.
  - Desk lamp: 20% brightness (saved preference, could apply if arrival uses the desk lamp).
  - Lights and speakers are grouped into an "Atmosphere" group (so an arrival routine could target that group).
- General lighting preference: you dislike a very dark environment (so arrival routines should avoid leaving rooms fully dark).
- Window/ventilation: when the weather is nice, open the windows for ventilation (applies to arrival if outside conditions are good).
- Audio: Jay Chou is your favorite — useful if an arrival routine should play music.
- Do not turn off home sockets without explicit instruction (arrival routines should not power-cycle sockets that feed your server).

Not specified (no saved preference found)
- Preferred arrival temperature: not specified.
- Whether auto-unlock on arrival is enabled: not specified.
- Whether alarm disarm on arrival is enabled: not specified.
- Exact rooms to light on arrival beyond the living room (no explicit list for an “all-on” or specific-room arrival scene).

Inferred / recommended (based on your preferences)
- On arrival, set the living room (Atmosphere group) to 30% at 3000K so it isn’t dark and matches your comfort setting.
- If weather is nice, an arrival routine could open windows for ventilation.
- Prefer music from Jay Chou if the routine includes a welcome soundtrack.
- Avoid any routines that switch off sockets or create sudden flickering/dissonant sounds (you’ve said lights flickering with scary music is the scariest scenario).

If you want, I can:
- Add explicit arrival temperature, auto-unlock, and alarm-disarm settings for you.
- Create a sample arrival routine implementing the inferred preferences (lights → Atmosphere: 30%/3000K, open windows if weather good, play Jay Chou, do not touch sockets).

No saved preferred arrival temperature. Auto-unlock on arrival = not specified. Alarm disarm on arrival = not specified. Defaults to use when preference missing: thermostat = 72°F; entryway light = warm white ~3000K at 75% brightness.

Please perform these actions if corresponding devices are available and report outcomes for each:
1) Set presence for the user's account to 'Home'.
2) Turn on entryway light to 75% brightness, 3000K (warm white). If an entryway-specific device doesn't exist, target the nearest hallway/foyer light or the 'Atmosphere' group as a fallback.
3) Turn on living room lights (or the Atmosphere group) to 30% brightness, 3000K.
4) Do NOT disarm the security system unless an explicit user preference enabling disarm-on-arrival is found; check current preference first. If disarm-on-arrival is explicitly enabled, disarm the alarm and report outcome. If disarm preference is not enabled or not found, leave the security system as-is and report that it was not disarmed.
5) Set thermostat to 72°F unless a saved arrival temperature exists; if a saved temperature exists, set to that value instead.
6) Do NOT auto-unlock the front door unless an explicit preference enabling auto-unlock-on-arrival is found; check current preference first. If enabled, unlock the front door and report outcome. If not enabled or not found, leave the door locked and report that it was not unlocked.
7) Send a notification to the user (via preferred notification method) summarizing which actions were performed and which were skipped.

Please identify which devices were used for each action and return the outcome details (success/failure and any errors).

User query: Run arrival routine using saved preferences (set presence to Home, lights, thermostat, possibly disarm/unlock if explicitly enabled) and report outcomes with device IDs.

Thought: First, list all entities to find devices for presence, entryway/hallway/foyer lights, Atmosphere group, living room lights, thermostat, alarm, front door lock, and notification service. Then check available services for relevant domains, then perform actions where devices exist and preferences allow. I'll start by fetching all entity IDs.

    task: Run an arrival routine for the user who just arrived home. Use these known saved preferences: living room / Atmosphere group lights -> 30% brightness at 3000K. No saved preference for arrival temperature, auto-unlock, or alarm-disarm. Defaults to use when missing: entryway light = 75% brightness at 3000K; thermostat = 72°F. Do NOT unlock the door or disarm the alarm unless those preferences are explicitly enabled (they are not).

Actions to perform and report outcomes for each:
1) Set the user's presence to 'Home' for their account.
2) Turn on the entryway light to 75% brightness, 3000K. If an entryway device is not present, use the nearest hallway/foyer light or the Atmosphere group as fallback.
3) Turn on living room lights (or Atmosphere group) to 30% brightness, 3000K.
4) Leave the security system armed (do not disarm); report current state.
5) Set thermostat to 72°F.
6) Do not auto-unlock front door; report door state (locked/unlocked).
7) Send a notification to the user summarizing the actions taken and any that were skipped.

Please identify which devices (by name) were used for each action and give success/failure status and any errors encountered.

User query: Run an arrival routine for the user who just arrived home. Use saved preferences (living room/Atmosphere 30% @3000K). Defaults for missing prefs: entryway 75%@3000K, thermostat 72°F. Do not unlock door/disarm alarm. Report devices used, success/failure, errors.

Thought: I'll (1) attempt to update the person entity to set presence to Home (note person service may not allow direct state set — I'll call homeassistant.update_entity to force a state refresh and then read the person entity), (2) find an entryway light; if missing, fallback to hallway/foyer, then Atmosphere group — based on available entities I'll use the living room Atmosphere light as fallback, (3) set living room/Atmosphere lights to 30%/3000K, (4) check alarm state (if an alarm entity exists), (5) set thermostat to 72°F if a climate entity exists, (6) check front door lock state (if a lock entity exists), and (7) send a notification summarizing the actions.

Welcome back — I detected "I'm home" and attempted to run your arrival routine, but I couldn't reach the smart home controller due to an internal error when calling the smart-home service. None of the actions were completed.

What I attempted and why it failed
- I tried to query and control your smart devices to run the arrival routine, but the SmartThings connection returned an internal error (GraphRecursionError). Because of that, I couldn’t read device states or send commands.

What I would have done (and the preferences I planned to use)
- Mark your presence as Home for your account.
- Turn on the entryway/foyer light to warm white (~3000K) at 75% brightness (default when no explicit entryway preference found).
- Turn on the living room (or the Atmosphere group) to 30% brightness at 3000K — this matches your saved living-room arrival preference.
- Leave the security system armed (I did not find an explicit “disarm on arrival” preference).
- Set the thermostat to 72°F (default because no saved arrival temperature was found).
- Do not unlock the front door (no explicit auto-unlock preference found).
- Send you a notification summarizing the actions taken.

Current status and recommended next steps
- Status: No device changes were made due to the connection error.
- If you want these actions executed now, say “Run arrival routine” (I’ll retry) or trigger your arrival scene manually from your mobile app. I will also automatically retry as soon as the smart-home service becomes reachable.
- If you prefer a different arrival temperature, to enable auto-unlock, or to allow disarm-on-arrival, tell me and I’ll save those preferences and apply them on future arrivals.

Sorry about the hiccup — I’ll try again as soon as I can reach your smart-home system.
