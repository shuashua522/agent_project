Name: SmartThingsPlannerTool

Device Ids:
- light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 (米家智能台灯Lite)
- light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 (灯泡)
- media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a (小米AI音箱（第二代）)
- switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1 (插座)
- button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1 (米家智能台灯Lite 开关状态切换) — alternative control
- button.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_stop_alarm_a_6_1 (小米AI音箱 停止闹钟) — alternative for speaker
- notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_execute_text_directive_a_7_4 (小米AI音箱 执行文本指令) — alternative for speaker

Capabilities:
- light (for light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 and light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2) — e.g., light.turn_off, light.toggle
- switch (for switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1) — e.g., switch.turn_off
- media_player (for media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a) — e.g., media_player.turn_off, media_player.media_stop
- button (for button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1 and button.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_stop_alarm_a_6_1) — alternative control actions (toggle / stop)
- notify (for notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_execute_text_directive_a_7_4) — can send a stop/idle directive as fallback if media_player.off fails

Plan:
1. Interior lights (non-essential)
   - Primary action: Call light.turn_off on:
     - light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2
     - light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2
   - Fallbacks if light.turn_off fails:
     - Use button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1 to toggle the Philips lamp off.
     - If a device reports no light capability, try any available button or switch control for that device.
   - Note: Do NOT change or toggle the lamp’s night-mode switch (switch.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_night_light_en_p_3_4). We will not touch that setting, per your “leave designated night/lobby lights” instruction.

2. Speaker / sound system (non-essential)
   - Primary action: Call media_player.turn_off on media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a.
   - Fallbacks if turn_off is not effective:
     - Call media_player.media_stop on media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a.
     - Use button.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_stop_alarm_a_6_1 if the sound is an alarm.
     - Use notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_execute_text_directive_a_7_4 to send a “stop playback” directive if available.
   - Do NOT change microphone mute (switch.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_mute_p_4_1) unless explicitly asked.

3. Smart plug / outlet powering small appliances (non-essential)
   - Primary action: Call switch.turn_off on switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1.

4. Other non-essential devices (decorative lights, robot vacuum, TV, consoles, non-security cameras, chargers)
   - Check for entities representing those devices. For any discovered:
     - If entity has light capability -> light.turn_off.
     - If entity has switch capability -> switch.turn_off.
     - If media_player -> media_player.turn_off / media_stop.
     - If only button capability exists for that device, use the appropriate button (toggle/stop).
   - For devices not present in the system (e.g., robot vacuum, TV, consoles) or for which we have no power-off capability, report them as “could not control / not present”.

5. Preserve essential devices and constraints
   - Do NOT change any door locks or alarm/security state (no lock or alarm entities are listed, and we will not modify such entities).
   - Do NOT change thermostat mode or setpoint (no thermostat entity is listed; we will not alter any thermostat).
   - Leave any clearly-essential devices (security sensors, CO/smoke detectors, refrigerator, medical devices) alone. None of those are present in the available entity list; if they are present elsewhere, do not touch them.

6. Verification & reporting
   - After each action attempt, query the entity state to verify it changed to “off” (or an equivalent idle state). If verification fails or state is ambiguous, attempt a fallback control and then report the device as “unable to control” if it remains unchanged.
   - Produce a summary listing:
     - Devices that were turned off (entities we successfully set to off).
     - Devices that were left on (essential devices or those we intentionally did not touch, e.g., night-light switch).
     - Devices that we could not control or that were already off (if state was already off, report as already off; if control failed, report as could not control).

Expected services / calls to run (examples to execute):
- service: light.turn_off
  - entity_id: light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2
  - entity_id: light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2
- service: switch.turn_off
  - entity_id: switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1
- service: media_player.turn_off (or media_player.media_stop)
  - entity_id: media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a
- Fallbacks if above fail:
  - service: button.press (or appropriate button action)
    - entity_id: button.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_toggle_a_2_1
    - entity_id: button.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_stop_alarm_a_6_1
  - service: notify.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a_execute_text_directive_a_7_4 with payload: “stop playback” (if supported)

Explanation / Notes:
- Devices controlled: I will target the listed light, switch, and media_player entities above. These match the non-essential categories you provided (interior lights, speakers, smart plug).
- Devices intentionally not changed: switch.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_night_light_en_p_3_4 (night light setting) — I will not modify night-mode settings; door locks, alarm state, thermostat mode and setpoints will not be altered.
- Ambiguous devices: If a device’s state is ambiguous after attempting a turn_off, I will attempt a fallback action (toggle/stop). If still ambiguous or if the entity lacks a proper off control, I will report it as “could not control.”
- Devices not present: No robot vacuum, TV, gaming console, explicit cameras, thermostats, locks, or alarm entities are in the provided list. If you have additional devices you want included, provide their entity IDs and I will include them in the actions.
- Safety: No changes will be made to locks, alarm state, thermostat mode or setpoints, smoke/CO detectors, refrigerator or any medical device.

If you’d like, I can now:
- Execute these actions (I will call the services listed and then return the verification summary), or
- First run a read-only check to report current on/off state for each device before making changes, so you can confirm.

Which would you prefer?

User query: Getting ready to go out. Turn off all non-essential devices. Non-essential devices typically include: interior lights (except designated night/lobby lights if present), TVs, sound systems/speakers, gaming consoles, smart plugs powering small appliances (coffee maker, toaster, slow cooker), robot vacuum if currently cleaning, decorative lights, smart outlets for chargers, and any non-security cameras. Essential devices to leave on: security system, door locks, refrigerator, smoke and CO detectors, medical devices, and the thermostat only if necessary to maintain set temperature (do not change thermostat mode or setpoint). Do NOT change door locks or the alarm state. Do NOT change thermostat mode. If any device's status is ambiguous, attempt to turn it off unless it is clearly essential. After completing actions, provide a summary listing which devices were turned off and which were left on, and report any devices you could not control or were already off.

Thought: Identify and turn off the non-essential devices available in the system: interior lights, speaker, smart plug. Preserve night-light setting and do not change locks, alarm, or thermostat. Attempt primary off actions and use fallbacks if a direct off fails. Then verify state changes.

Action: Call light.turn_off for the Philips bedside lamp entity.

- switch.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_night_light_en_p_3_4 (night-light setting) — not changed; preserved in case it is a designated night/lobby light.
- No door locks, alarm/security entities, thermostat, smoke/CO detectors, refrigerator, or medical device entities were present in the device list I used; none were modified. Per your instructions, I did not change any lock or alarm state, nor thermostat mode or setpoint.

Devices already off or could not control:
- All targeted non-essential devices in the available list were successfully turned off or stopped. The only minor control anomaly: media_player.turn_off returned a 400 Bad Request, so I used media_player.media_stop which succeeded. No devices remain that I could not control from the provided entity list.

Notes and safety:
- I did not change locks, alarm state, thermostat modes, or any potentially essential devices.
- If you have other devices (TVs, gaming consoles, robot vacuums, decorative lights, additional smart plugs, or non-security cameras) not included in the entity list I acted on, provide their entity IDs and I will turn them off as requested.
- Device IDs I acted on: light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2, light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2, media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a, switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1.

If you want, I can:
- Run a state-check for other entity IDs you care about before turning them off, or
- Proceed to turn off any additional devices you list now.

Name: SmartThingsTool

User query: Getting ready to go out. Turn off all non-essential devices. Non-essential devices typically include: interior lights (except designated night/lobby lights if present), TVs, sound systems/speakers, gaming consoles, smart plugs powering small appliances (coffee maker, toaster, slow cooker), robot vacuum if currently cleaning, decorative lights, smart outlets for chargers, and any non-security cameras. Essential devices to leave on: security system, door locks, refrigerator, smoke and CO detectors, medical devices, and the thermostat only if necessary to maintain set temperature (do not change thermostat mode or setpoint). Do NOT change door locks or the alarm state. Do NOT change thermostat mode. If any device's status is ambiguous, attempt to turn it off unless it is clearly essential. After completing actions, provide a summary listing which devices were turned off and which were left on, and report any devices you could not control or were already off.

Thought: Identify and turn off the non-essential devices available in the system: interior lights, speaker, smart plug. Preserve night-light setting and do not change locks, alarm, or thermostat. Attempt primary off actions and use fallbacks if a direct off fails. Then verify state changes.

Done — I turned off the non‑essential devices I could access and left essential systems alone. Summary:

Turned off / stopped
- 卧室的米家智能台灯Lite — light.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_s_2 — turned off.
- 客厅的灯泡 — light.yeelink_cn_1162511951_mbulb3_s_2 — turned off.
- 插座  开关 — switch.cuco_cn_269067598_cp1_on_p_2_1 — turned off.
- 小米AI音箱（第二代） (speaker) — media_player.xiaomi_cn_701074704_l15a — media_player.turn_off returned 400 Bad Request, so I used media_player.media_stop; result: stopped (no playback).

Left unchanged (intentionally)
- Night / lobby light setting — switch.philips_cn_1061200910_lite_night_light_en_p_3_4 (preserved as requested).
- I did not modify door locks, alarm/security state, thermostat mode or setpoint, smoke/CO detectors, refrigerator, or any medical devices (none of those were changed).

Controls that failed or were already off
- media_player.turn_off returned an error but media_player.media_stop succeeded, so the speaker is silenced/stopped.
- All targeted non‑essential devices available to me were successfully turned off or stopped; none remained that I could not control.

Notes
- I followed your instructions not to change locks, alarm state, or thermostat mode/setpoint.
- If there are other non‑essential devices you want off (TVs, gaming consoles, robot vacuum, additional smart plugs, decorative lights, non‑security cameras), tell me their names or entity IDs and I will turn them off.
