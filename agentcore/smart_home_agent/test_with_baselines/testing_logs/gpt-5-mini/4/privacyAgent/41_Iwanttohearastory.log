Preferences are: Group the light bulbs and speakers into the 'Atmosphere' group; Remember that I prefer the living room light to be at 30% brightness; The desk lamp is too bright—adjusting its brightness to 20% is sufficient; Oh, when sleeping, I don't like a dark environment as it scares me; Let's play Jay Chou's songs instead—they are my favorite; When I'm on a call, don't let the devices make noise; Oh, there is a bathroom in my room; When reading, I like to sit on the living room sofa because when I'm tired, looking at the living room plants helps me relax; Do not turn off the home sockets without my explicit instruction—they are connected to my server; The living room light at 3000K makes me feel the most comfortable; I like warm and healing stories about animals and children; The gateway's WiFi is currently connected to my hotspot (dddiu); Do you know what the scariest scenario is? Lights flickering with scary background music; Before going to bed, I will play with my phone for a while—set the lights to fade out and turn off after 30 minutes; On Sundays, I usually get up at dawn; During summer vacation, I sleep on the living room sofa every night and keep the windows open, which makes me sleep soundly; I usually go to bed at 11 PM and get up around 7 AM; When the weather is nice, open the windows for ventilation

On the edge of a small town, where the sidewalks met a line of friendly oaks, lived a child named Mei and a little fox with one white paw. They met one rainy afternoon when Mei stretched out a hand beneath the eaves and the fox, dripping and curious, nudged it as if to say hello. From that moment, they became quiet companions.

Each evening they had a gentle ritual. Mei would curl up on the living room sofa beside a window filled with potted green leaves, and the fox would settle into the crook of her knees. A warm lamp cast a soft, honeyed glow over them. Mei made a cup of warm milk with a hint of honey; the fox watched the steam and let out a tiny, satisfied sigh. Outside, the rain tapped a calm, steady rhythm on the roof, like a friendly drummer keeping time.

They told each other stories without many words. Mei would hum a little tune she liked, a soft melody that felt like the hush after a long day, and the fox would close its eyes as if listening to the spaces between the notes. Sometimes they imagined traveling to a meadow full of glowing fireflies; other nights they pretended the sofa was a ship and the plants were a slow, waving sea. The whole room felt like a safe harbor where small worries unravelled and loosened like knots in a rope.

One winter evening, a wind came that rattled the chimney and left a sprinkle of frost on the sill. Mei noticed the fox shivering and wrapped a patchwork blanket around both of them. The fox pressed its warm head against her palm and, for the first time, Mei whispered aloud all the little hopes she kept in her pocket—things like being brave at school and planting new seeds in spring. The fox answered in its own way, pressing a soft paw into her hand as if to promise companionship for whatever came next.

As the night deepened, the lamp dimmed to a gentle glow and the room felt like the pause between two breaths. Mei drifted toward sleep with the fox curled by her side, the plants nodding in the window like watchful friends. Outside, the rain softened. Inside, there was only the small, steady chorus of comfort: a warm blanket, a hummed melody, and the quiet, steady presence of someone who cared.

When dawn came, everything looked a little brighter than before—because sometimes, the smallest acts of kindness, the sharing of a blanket or a breath of a tune, make the world a softer place. Mei and the fox woke ready for a new day, carrying with them the calm of the night and the promise of more gentle stories to come.
