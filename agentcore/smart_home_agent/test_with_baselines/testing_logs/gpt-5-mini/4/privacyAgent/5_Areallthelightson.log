I checked your stored preferences and there are no smart‑home device entries saved right now — so I don't have any light device names or IDs to report.

Would you like help next? I can:
- Connect to or guide you through a specific smart‑home system (Alexa, Google Home, Philips Hue, Apple HomeKit, etc.) to discover devices, or
- Walk you through finding and sharing the device names/IDs from your hub/app so I can store them, or
- Let you paste a list now and I’ll save it for future queries.

Which would you prefer?

I can't determine whether all lights are on because there are no light devices registered in my memory.

To proceed, pick one of these actions by sending the corresponding message:
- Reply with "discover devices" and name your smart‑home platform (Alexa, Google Home, Philips Hue, Apple HomeKit, etc.) so I can look up your lights and report which are on/off.
- Paste a list of your light device names and IDs from your hub/app here and I'll check their states.
- Tell me you've already connected a specific hub and want me to try reading device status; I will then attempt the check.

Note: some smart‑home data may be privacy‑processed and returned encrypted — if any tool call returns encrypted text I will retain those encrypted strings exactly as given.
